    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon pepper</li>
        <li>16 sea scallops, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons lemon juice, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, oregano, thyme and lemon pepper. Roll scallops in flour
            mixture<br>
            until lightly
            coated on all sides.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a skillet or frying pan over high heat. Add 4 scallops to the pan and sear on all
            sides<br>
            (about 2
            minutes for each side). After turning scallops, add 1 tablespoon parsley and 1 teaspoon lemon juice.<br>
            Remove
            scallops
            from pan and place on a plate in the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Repeat until remaining scallops are cooked, tossing each batch with parsley and lemon juice.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>
        <em>I have also added Parmesan cheese to these while they are in the oven, which adds another flavor dimension.
