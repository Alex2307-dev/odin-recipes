    <h1>Instant Pot Asparagus Brie Soup</h1>
    <p><b>
            This creamy asparagus soup comes together in no time in your Instant Pot®. The Brie adds a subtle flavor
            and<br>
            contributes
            to the creaminess of the soup, without being overpowering. Perfect to make for Sunday brunch with the
            girls,<br>
            or
            a dinner
            party starter with friends. Garnish with garlic croutons and freshly-grated lemon zest, if desired.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil
            over<br>
            medium heat.
            Add shallots and garlic and stir for 1 minute, taking care not to burn them. Add in asparagus pieces and<br>
            stir to
            combine. Continue to saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour chicken broth into the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high
            pressure<br>
            according to
            manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about
            5<br>
            minutes.
            Unlock and remove the lid. Remove a few pieces of asparagus tops to use for garnish and set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add Brie pieces to soup in the Instant Pot. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until creamy and<br>
            smooth. Stir in
            heavy cream. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Ladle into bowls and garnish with reserved<br>
            asparagus tops.
