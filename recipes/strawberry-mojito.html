    <h1>Strawberry Mojito</h1>
    <p><b>
            This strawberry mojito recipe makes the perfect drink for a hot summer day! I had this drink at a popular
            chain
            restaurant<br> and decided to try it at home. I have served it at several different gatherings, and it has
            always
            been given
            rave reviews.

    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li>
            Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the rims of 8 cocktail
            glasses,<br> then
            dip the rims into sugar to coat; set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes into the pitcher along with
            mint,<br>
            strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with a muddler to release strawberry juice and mint oil. Stir in club
            soda and<br> rum
            until sugar has dissolved.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour into the prepared glasses over ice cubes to serve.
