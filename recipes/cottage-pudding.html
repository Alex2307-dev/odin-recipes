    <h1>Cottage Pudding (Cake for Strawberry Shortcake)</h1>
    <p><b>
            This is a wonderful shortcake recipe my grandmother used to make for strawberry shortcake.<br> It is moist
            and
            sweet and can
            be eaten by itself too.

            Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square cake pan.<br> Whisk the flour,
            baking
            powder, and
            salt together in a bowl; set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Beat the shortening and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy.<br> Beat in the
            egg
            and vanilla
            extract until smooth. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until<br> just
            incorporated.
            Pour the
            batter into prepared pan.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.<br>

            pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
